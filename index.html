    <h1>Superhero trivia</h1>

    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>

    <p>
      A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability
      to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't.
      So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional
      than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to
      use that power to accomplish good deeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
      police story or detective story or human-interest story.
      But if itâ€™s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy,
      it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something
      that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish,
      then I assume he becomes a superhero.
